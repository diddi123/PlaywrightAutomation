Auto-retrying assertions:
The following assertions will retry until the assertion passes, or the assertion timeout is reached. Note that retrying assertions are async, so you must await them.

Non-retrying assertions:

These assertions allow to test any conditions, but do not auto-retry. Most of the time, web pages show information asynchronously, and using non-retrying assertions can lead to a flaky test.

Prefer auto-retrying assertions whenever possible. For more complex assertions that need to be retried, use expect.poll or expect.toPass.
